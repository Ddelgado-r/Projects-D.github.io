        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>  
            <img src="./images/Colombia.jpeg" alt="Image of Colombia, a country full of beauties." width="40%"><br>
            Colombia is an abundant pantry of products,
            flavors, and culinary knowledge that materialize
            our cultural heritage: stories, recipes, cooking
            techniques, rites, and myths around food.
        </p>
        <p>
            This wealth, as well as a variety of animals
            and plants, must be used sustainably
            to guarantee their protection. This implies
            generating and reinforcing processes that
            encourage their continued use, not only as a
            strategy to conserve them, but as a mechanism
            to keep our culinary and cultural heritage alive.
        </p>
        <p>In the following pages the reader will find a
            collection of recipes, techniques and products
            that inspired us to nurture Colombian
            gastronomy and keep it alive.

                    <p>
                        Remove the corn kernels from the cobs with a knife.
                        In a blender or food processor, place the corn, eggs,
                        sugar, salt, flour, and half of the cheese, and blend
                        until you get a homogeneous mass.
                        Divide into eight portions and form an arepa with
                        each one.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In a nonstick skillet over medium heat, melt 15 g
                        of butter and grill one arepa at a time. Let it cook
                        on one side until browned (for approximately four
                        minutes), flip and cook on the other side in the same
                        way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Right before it is cooked, add a tablespoon of cheese,
                        fold in half making sure that the cheese is covered,
                        and set aside. Do the same with every arepa and
                        serve them warm with the honey drizzled on.

                    <p>In a bowl, mix the coconut and the arequipe until they are integrated. Let the mixture cool.</p>
                    <p>Form small balls with a spoon and toss them in the rice flour to coat them evenly. Store in a tightly covered container and serve at room temperature</p>
